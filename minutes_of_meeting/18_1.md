We discussed the basic requirements that our application will need. Starting a project in the personal space, Sharing it if the user is willing, upvoting a journal, follow goal/users, query goal/user, profile of user, commenting under journals/progresses, feed (optional), personal message (optional). We are yet to decide what will be our development model for this project but we are thinking of agile deveopment methodology.
